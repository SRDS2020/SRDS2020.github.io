      <h4><b>Towards Smarter Cities: Using Trajectory Data for Vehicle Routing</b></h4>
      <br />
      <p style=" text-align: justify;">
        Massive vehicle trajectory data captures detailed information about vehicular transportation and holds the potential to transform vehicle routing profoundly, thus improving transportation and contributing to enabling smarter cities. When trajectory data is used, the traditional routing paradigm is inadequate. Instead, new and data-intensive paradigms that thrive on massive trajectory data are called for. The talk covers three such paradigms, including so-called path-based routing, where costs are associated with paths and not just edges; on-the-fly routing, where all weights are not pre-computed, but are computed as needed during routing; and cost-oblivious routing, where no costs are associated with routes, but where historical trajectories are used directly for routing.

      <h4><b>Erasure Codes for Fast Data Repairing in Distributed Storage Systems</b></h4>
      <br />
      <p style=" text-align: justify;">
        In order to prevent data unavailability in the face of various failures, practical large-scale distributed storage systems are expected to apply erasure codes to maintain system reliability. However, the amount of data required during the repair process is much greater than the amount of the failed data. This heavy recovery burden dramatically hinders data reliability and system performance. We proposed 2 types of Erasure Codes to improve data repairing performance in the distributed storage systems. Assume an Erasure Code is represented as (k, m, d), where k is the number of data blocks, m is the number of check blocks, and d is the number of blocks to be accessed during data recovery. We propose Hybrid Regenerating Codes (Hybrid-RC) for d&lt;k, a family of erasure codes that is near-optimal with respect to storage and repair cost. Compared to the Local Reconstruction Codes (LRC) with the same storage overhead, Hybrid-RC has lower degraded read cost and lower reconstruction cost. Another erasure code proposed is Arbitrary Helper Minimum Storage Regenerating Codes (AHC), which allows for bandwidth-efficient repair of a single data block failure with an arbitrary (but fixed) number of helper nodes d between k and n-1. The straggling block or congested nodes can be avoided during repairing and thus recovery performance remains efficient. In general, despite different network-and-load states, AHC can always find a proper set of parameters to attain high repair efficiency in a distributed storage system.

      <h4><b>Challenges and Opportunities for Performance and Reliability of Distributed Systems in Post Moore’s Law Era</b></h4>
      <br />
      <p style=" text-align: justify;">
        As the Moore’s Law is ending, along with the ended Dennard Scaling Law due to the physical limits, we are entering a new computing era where a variety of parallel and highly customized hardware accelerators co-exist with general-purpose processors in distributed systems. After many years’ development, the CPU-based ecosystem has become a one-size-fit-all environment that has attracted all kinds of applications. However, its computing- and power-efficiencies have dramatically decreased. To improve overall performance by cutting short of various data paths in processing and communication systems, system reliably that has been established in the existing systems is also challenged.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this talk, I will address the limits and challenges of existing computing environment driven by the Moore’s Law. I will also present cases of high performance and distributed data processing by including advanced hardware devices, including GPU, RDMA, and SSD. I will present the trade-offs between the performance improvement and weakening of reliability All the related algorithms and software implementations are open sourced, some of which have been adopted in major production systems.
